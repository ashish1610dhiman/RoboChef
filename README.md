## Background
Machine Learning systems today aid decision making across the entrire spectrum of life. One of such relevant decision, that each human has to make daily is his Meal Choice. The said decision depends on a multitude of factors like nutritional requirements, eating prefrences and mood etc. Thus Meal Choice presents lot of variability not only in between two different indviduals but also for the same indvidual.

In this project we thus aim to build a ML system, that aids multiple aspects of Meal Choice decision.

## Problem Definition
As stated above, we want to target multiple aspects of the Meal Choice decision:

1. **Given an image of a food item, what are the key ingredients in the food?**
2. **Given my previous interaction with food items, can you recommend me similar foods?**
    * Can the reccomendation also account for additional constraints placed by me like nutritional requirements etc ?

### Usecases
The modular nature of above problems lends to multiple usecases:
* When encountered with an unknown food item, the user might want to know its ingredients, such that he can figure out:
    - If the dish is healthy?
    - If the dish contains allergens?
